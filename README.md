Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

pip package manager

Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

bash
cd backend
(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn scikit-learn
Run the backend server:

bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
The backend will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:8000

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
cd ../frontend
Start a simple HTTP server (Python 3.x):

bash
python -m http.server 8080
Open your browser and go to:

text
http://localhost:8080
Usage
Select your preferences (occasion, temperature, color vibe, budget).

Click Get Outfit Ideas.

View personalized outfit suggestions.

Use Like or Dislike buttons to provide feedback.

Submit additional comments to help improve recommendations.

Notes
The backend uses a hybrid approach combining rule-based filtering and ML-based content similarity.

User feedback is stored in-memory for demo purposes; replace with persistent storage for production.

The product catalog reflects NexusPointLuxe’s style and pricing but is static.

Future Enhancements
Persistent user profiles and history storage.

Real-time weather and calendar integration.

Virtual try-on and 3D outfit visualization.

Deployment to cloud platforms for public access.
